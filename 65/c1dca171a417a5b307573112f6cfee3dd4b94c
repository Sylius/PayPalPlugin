Hello @Zales0123 @SirDomin and others ;)

I fixed the bug that made two new payments (one in `new` and one in `cart`) when cancelling a payment.
Because of this, the order was broken.

Regards

Hello,

This bug is still present, so I've rebased my branch to make it compatible with the new version.

Can you take a look? Ping @GSadee
